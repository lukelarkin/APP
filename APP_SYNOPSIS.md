# TARU App - Comprehensive Synopsis

**Last Updated:** October 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation Components

---

## Executive Summary

TARU is a trauma-informed iOS addiction recovery app that combines Jungian archetypes, Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy, and just-in-time adaptive interventions to help users heal from tech-based addictions (primarily porn and gambling). The app emphasizes reconnection with authentic self, Ubuntu philosophy ("I am because we are"), and compassionate intervention over shame-based approaches.

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### Strengths:
- **Strong conceptual foundation** - Psychology-based approach with trauma-informed principles
- **Unique positioning** - Combines archetypes, IFS, Ubuntu philosophy in novel way
- **Quality UI components** - Well-structured, accessible, visually polished
- **Comprehensive specification** - Trigger system and behavioral rationale well-documented
- **Thoughtful intervention content** - Non-shaming, archetype-specific, emotionally resonant

### Challenges:
- **Backend entirely missing** - All server-side infrastructure needs building
- **No user auth** - Can't persist data across devices or users
- **Extension dependency** - Core value proposition requires external browser extension
- **Timing requirements** - 5-second intervention delivery is aggressive target
- **Privacy concerns** - Handling sensitive browsing data requires careful design
- **Community moderation** - User-generated content needs safety systems

### Opportunities:
- **AI differentiation** - Athena could be major value-add with right implementation
- **Wearable data** - Early integration with Apple Watch could set apart from competitors
- **Clinical partnerships** - Trauma-informed approach suitable for therapist collaboration
- **Content marketplace** - Allow therapists/mentors to create intervention content
- **B2B potential** - Corporate wellness programs or treatment centers

## üìö DOCUMENTATION STATUS

**Excellent:**
- `trigger_spec.md` - Comprehensive technical specification for trigger system

- Code comments - Components are well-documented with intent and psychology

**Missing:**
- Architecture overview
- API documentation

- GDPR compliance (if expanding beyond US)
- Age verification (adult content context)

---

## üé® DESIGN & UX STATUS

**Complete:**
- Dark theme with warm, calming colors
- Consistent component styling
- Accessible tap targets
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Emoji-based visual communication

**Needs Refinement:**
- Loading states
- Error handling UI
- Empty states
- Onboarding flow continuation (after archetype reveal)
- Settings screen
- Profile screen
- Help/support section

---

## üì± PLATFORM CONSIDERATIONS

**Current State:**

- Corporate/clinical licensing
- Mentor/therapist marketplace commissions

---

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS (Not Yet Tracked)

**User Engagement:**

---

## CONCLUSION

TARU Phase 1 represents a **solid foundation of UI components** with **thoughtful psychological design** and **clear technical specifications**. The archetype system, IFS check-in, and nervous system resets are fully functional and ready for user testing. However, the app is **not yet deployable** as it lacks critical infrastructure:

1. **Backend systems** (auth, API, database)
2. **Push notifications** and intervention delivery
3. **Browser extension** for trigger detection
4. **Community functionality** backend

**The next priority** should be establishing the core backend infrastructure and user authentication system, followed by implementing the trigger-to-intervention pipeline that forms the app's unique value proposition. Once these systems are in place, the existing UI components can be connected to create a functional MVP ready for beta testing.

The **vision is ambitious but achievable** with systematic execution. The strong conceptual foundation and quality of existing components suggest this could be a genuinely helpful tool for people struggling with tech-based addictions.
