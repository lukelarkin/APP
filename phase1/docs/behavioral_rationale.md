# Behavioral and Design Rationale for TARU Phase 1

TARU’s core mission is to help people heal from tech‑based addictions by reconnecting them to their authentic selves.  To achieve this, we draw on trauma‑informed psychotherapy, Jungian archetypes and the hero’s journey.  Below we outline the reasoning behind the new Phase 1 features and how they support recovery.

## 1. Archetype‑Based Onboarding

* **Intent:** Quickly orient users within a mythic framework that reduces shame and cultivates curiosity.  By identifying with an archetype (e.g. Warrior, Sage, Lover, Seeker), users adopt an aspirational identity that reframes relapse as part of a larger journey.
* **Psychology:** Carl Jung’s archetypal theory suggests that universal patterns shape human behaviour.  When people recognise their archetype, they feel seen and less isolated.  The brief quiz avoids pathologising language and instead asks about motivations, environments and coping styles.
* **Personalisation:** Each archetype determines Athena’s tone (mentor, challenger, comrade or guide), the order of IFS parts to address, and the priority of substitution interventions.  This ensures interventions feel customised and meaningful from the outset.

## 2. IFS Daily Check‑In

* **Intent:** Encourage users to regularly scan their internal landscape and build “Self‑led” streaks rather than focusing on abstinence streaks, which can be shame‑inducing when broken.
* **Psychology:** Internal Family Systems posits that inner “parts” protect us from pain but can become extreme.  Naming which part is active (e.g. Inner Critic or Wounded Child) cultivates awareness and compassion.  Over time, users develop the capacity to lead from Self rather than letting protector parts drive compulsive behaviour.
* **Gamification:** The Self‑meter and streak counter reward daily reflection without triggering addictive loops.  A weekly cadence (7‑day segments) aligns with research indicating that short, repeated practices foster habits.  “Ubuntu tokens” celebrate connection and service, not just individual achievement.

## 3. Community Connection

* **Intent:** Combat isolation by making it easy to reach out, celebrate wins and participate in group rituals.  Many addiction cycles thrive in secrecy; regular positive contact counteracts this.
* **Psychology:** Gabor Maté emphasises that addiction is rooted in disconnection and trauma.  Sharing gratitude and receiving support help regulate the nervous system and reinforce secure attachment.  Ubuntu philosophy (“I am because we are”) frames recovery as a collective journey.
* **Lightweight Design:** Early versions avoid real‑time chat to reduce overwhelm.  Instead, users send short notes of gratitude or schedule structured rituals.  This scaffolding prevents relapse triggers while still fostering community.

## 4. Substitution Interventions

* **Intent:** Provide quick, embodied alternatives when cravings arise.  Based on Patrick Carnes and Tony Robbins, we recognise that shifting state and story disrupts the compulsion–shame cycle.
* **Loved‑One Letters:** Hearing from someone who believes in you taps into attachment systems and counters shame.  Many people continue to relapse despite logic; emotional reminders of love cut through cognitive defences.
* **Wilderness Journaling:** Writing prompts inspired by Marcus Aurelius and nature therapy encourage reflection and reconnection with the body.  Spending even a few minutes in mindful writing can lower arousal.
* **Gratitude Rituals:** Ubuntu‑style ceremonies (e.g. naming those you are grateful for) build prosocial emotions.  Gratitude has been shown to increase resilience and reduce impulsivity.

## 5. Trauma‑Informed and Ethical Considerations

* **Non‑judgmental Tone:** Athena never shames or lectures.  Instead, she uses compassionate prompts like “What am I unwilling to feel right now?” drawn from David Hawkins’ Letting Go.
* **Privacy:** The app avoids storing raw browsing data, aligning with Apple’s health‑data rules and ensuring sensitive information is not used for marketing【740281439305781†L1924-L1939】.
* **Opt‑In Community:** Users choose if and when to connect with mentors or peers.  We respect boundaries and normalise that recovery is nonlinear.

Together, these design choices create an environment where users feel safe to explore their shadows, practise self‑awareness and receive loving intervention exactly when they need it.  Phase 1 lays the foundation for deeper AI‑driven support in later releases.
